商业周期中的变化影响在不同资产类别的投资回报  

The business cycle has four phases:
商业周期有四个阶段：

- **Expansion** - this phase begins after a low point in the economy and is characterized by increased economic activity and real GDP increases.  
扩张-这一阶段开始在经济中的低点后，其特征是所增加的经济活动和实际国内生产总值增加。

- **Peak** - this is the period where the growth rate of the expansion slows, and the economy is in a period of prosperity.  
高峰-这是期间扩大的增长速度放缓，经济处于繁荣时期。

- **Contraction** - this follows the peak and is characterized by a reduction in GDP, as well as other business indicators. Also known as recession.  
 收缩-这遵循高峰期，特点是GDP以及其他业务指标减少。也被称为经济衰退。

- **Recovery** - this is where the contraction reaches bottom (also called a trough) and may be stagnant for a time before starting the next expansion.  
恢复 — — 这是由于收缩到达底部 (也称为波谷/低谷)，可能会停滞一段时间之前开始下一个扩展。


### 1.1.2 monetary and fiscal policy

- 货币政策，federal reserve board 美联储，决定国家货币供给 money supply

- 财政政策，president and congress 总统和国会，决定政府支出和税收。


### 1.1.3 US dollar valuation

强美元：美元升值，出口下降，进口上升，买更多外币
弱美元：美元贬值，出口上升，进口下降，买更少外币

### 1.1.4. inflation/deflation 通胀/通缩

inflation 通胀 表现为持续的价格增长，降低购买力

deflation 通缩，表现为持续的价格下跌，会侵蚀企业利润

### 1.1.5. interest rates and yield curves
  利息率与收益率曲线

Typically, when the supply of money increases, interest rates fall. And when the supply of money tightens, interest rates increase  
通常情况下，当货币供应增加，利率下降。当货币供应量的收紧，利率增加

When monetary policy expands credit, lower interest rates make bonds less appealing as investments, and stocks more appealing.  
当货币政策扩大信贷时，更低的利率使债券吸引力的投资，以及股票更有吸引力

 a 从企业角度来看，公司盈利可能增加，因为较低的利息支出，可能会导致市场股票价格的上升。

Of course, when the opposite occurs and monetary policy tightens credit, interest rates will rise, earnings will decrease, and the market price of the stock is likely to decrease as well. As interest rates rise, bonds become more attractive to investors.  
当然，相反，货币政策收紧信贷，利率将会上升，收入会减少，和股票的市场价格是倾向于减少以及。随着利率上升，债券成为对投资者更具吸引力。

正向曲线：normal yield curve 长期利率高于短期利率，  
反向曲线：inverted yield curve长期利率小于短期利率，经济衰退，  
flat yield curve
